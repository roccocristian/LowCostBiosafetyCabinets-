# LowCostBiosafetyCabinets-

## Objective
Create a low cost cabinets to be used for PPE Sterilization using UV light.

## License
I am stil thinking in the licence to be used. If you have any interest in the project or any sugestion for the license contact me.

# Planning

IMPORTANT: I do not take any responsibility and I am not liable for any damage caused through use of this project

## Recomendation
- The materials used may be changed due to safety issues (Electrical injury, fire)
- The Cabinet should only be touched after turned off.
- The object shoud me removed only after several minutes the cover is removed to avoid any toxic gas.
- The cabined should be used in a ventilated environment.

## Observation
- The UV light can produce ozone, allowing a two sterilization types of  at the same time.

## Limitations
- The use of UV light is not adequate for rough or multi layer objects.
- UV light can cause cell damage in humans or animals.
- Depending on the ozone production the environment can become toxic.

## Construction
- Consider the object to be sterilized. In this case basic PPE masks.
- Size used for the construction 46x46x26H cm (18x18x10H inches)
- Number of lamps: 2
- Power: 7 W each
- Voltage: 127 V
- Brand: OSRAM
- Model: HNS S 7 W G23 (this lamp should not produce ozone, although it was smelled something simillar to that. It requires further investigation)
- Light Lenght: 254 nm
- Power from 200nm to 280nm: 1.8 W
- Material used for UV reflection: Aluminiun paper, reflection expected 50 %
- Material used for the box: styrofoam and cardboard.

## Use
1. The cabin should be use closed, with both lights turned on.
2. The object to be sterilized should be rotated to allow direct light incidence
3. The object, in this case PPE masks, should be exposed for around 30 minutes each side.
4. After that time the cabin should be let with the object allowing the removal of any toxic gas (need further research of residual produced)
5. After that time the mask can be used again (it is recomended to be used only 3 times according to the pappers)
