# Planning

## Recomendation
- The Cabinet should only be touched after turned off.
- The object shoud me removed only after several minutes the cover is removed to avoid any toxic gas.
- The cabined should be used in a ventilated environment.

## Observation
- The UV light can produce ozone, allowing a two sterilization types of  at the same time.
- The materials used may be changed due to safety issues (Electrical injury, fire)

## Limitations
- The use of UV light is not adequate for rough or multi layer objects.
- UV light can cause cell damage in humans or animals.
- Depending on the ozone production the environment can become toxic.

## Construction
- Consider the object to be sterilized. In this case basic PPE masks.
- Size used for the construction 46x46x26H cm (18x18x10H inches)
- Number of lamps: 2
- Power: 7 W each
- Voltage: 127 V
- Brand: OSRAM
- Model: HNS S 7 W G23 (this lamp should not produce ozone, although it was smelled something simillar to that. It requires further investigation)
- Light Lenght: 254 nm
- Power from 200nm to 280nm: 1.8 W
- Material used for UV reflection: Aluminiun paper, reflection expected 50 %
- Material used for the box: styrofoam and cardboard.

I do not take any responsibility and I am not liable for any damage caused through use of this project
